                        I really like this picture. But I heard pictures can have hidden secrets, could you please take
                        a look at it and submit your findings?</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Just by looking at the title we guessed that there will be several layers of steganography
                        involved, and we found out that we were right! This findig is not necessary to solve the
                        challenge, but it certainly helps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We have a <span class="highlight">.jpg</span> file.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The first thing I do with pictures, is check the <span class="highlight">exif
                        </span> data, then move on to more special stego tools. There is instantly an interesting
                        finding in the exif data of the picture! It says <span class="highlight">copyright iLik3Cats
                        </span> and there is also a comment which says the same. We note down this phrase and keep
                        looking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We checked the picture with steghide, which is a famous stego tool. The command we used was quite
                        simple:</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="code">steghide extract -sf cat.jpg</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This unfortunately did not give us any results, neither without using a passpharse nor with using
                        <span class="highlight">iLik3Cats
                        </span> as a password.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The next idea was to try using <span class="highlight">binwalk</span> on the picture, to see if
                        there are any hidden files
                        inside. The idea came from checking the file size, which was much larger than a normal image, so
                        we thought there should be some hidden data or files inside. This indeed was the right choice!
                        After running <span class="highlight">binwalk</span> (for those who don't know, it's a tool for
                        extracting hidden or embedded data from files):
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="code">binwalk cat.jpg</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We found a hidden <span class="highlight">.zip</span> file in the picture. The output looked like
                        this:</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Since we've found this, and it does have the name <span class="highlight">music.wav</span>, let's
                        extract it with <span class="highlight">binwalk</span> (this will take a bit but shouldn't be
                        too long).</p>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">binwalk -e cat.jpg</span></li>
                <li>
                    <p>We got a password protected <span class="highlight">.zip</span> file, and when we tried to
                        extract it with the passphrase we got before <span class="highlight">(iLik3Cats)</span> it
                        extracted a <span class="highlight">.wav</span> file
                        successfully. After playing the file in any kind of media player, it immedieately came to us
                        that the sound file contained morse code, there were a lot of short and long beepings. There is
                        an online tool to decode morse code from sound files, we could have done it by hand, but since
                        the tool works fine we saved a lot of time by using it instead.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>This is an adaptive decoder, so we just had to upload the file, and it did the analysis and
                        decoding on it for us.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We ended up with a <span class="highlight">base64</span> looking string:</p>

                <li>
                    <p>After trying to decode it from <span class="highlight">base64</span>, it did not give us any
                        results.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We can use <a class="body-link" target="blank"

                            chef</a> to try decoding it, or we can also use the terminal like this:</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="code">echo -n OIZEKRBAGVAD6VSFEA6D6QCIEB6EAQ2EGZNSAM2GIUQHQIBVIA====== | base64

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>So as I said, neither of these worked, so we figured this isn't <span
                            class="highlight">base64</span>. It definitely looks like
                        some kinde of a base-encoding, so let's try other ones! After trying our 2nd guess, which was
                        <span class="highlight">base32</span>, (used <a class="body-link" target="blank"
                            href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base32('A-Z2-7%3D',true)&input=T0laRUtSQkFHVkFENlZTRkVBNkQ2UUNJRUI2RUFRMkVHWk5TQU0yR0lVUUhRSUJWSUE9PT09PT0">cyber
                            chef</a> for this too) we got back some interesting results!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="code">r2ED 5@?VE &lt;?@H |@CD6[ 3FE x 5@</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For someone who is very new to this, this might not mean much, but if you've solved a few
                        challenges like this before, you can immediately tell that this looks like some <span
                            class="highlight">ROT</span> encoding.
                        The reason for this is because the text looks like it's made of words, just the words have no
                        meaning and weird character order. When this is the case, <span class="highlight">ROT</span> is
                        usually the answer.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I've tried my favourite <span class="highlight">ROT</span> decoder out there, which runs all the
                        rotations through the text: <a class="body-link" href="http://theblob.org/rot.cgi">ROT
                            decoder</a>
                        But this <a class="body-link"
                            href="http://theblob.org/rot.cgi?text=r2ED+5%40%3FVE+%3C%3F%40H+%7C%40CD6%5B+3FE+x+5%40">didn't
                            work</a>. Looking at the text again, we noticed there are special characters in it
                        which aren't included in the basic ROT ABCs, so this should be some special kind of ROT or
                        something. We used <a class="body-link"
                            href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=ROT47(47)&input=cjJFRCA1QD9WRSA8P0BIIHxAQ0Q2WyAzRkUgeCA1QA">cyber
                            chef</a>
                        once more, trying the <span class="highlight">ROT47</span> coding on it, which led us to the end
                        of this challenge, because we successfully got the flag!
                        We didn't even need to wrap it in any kind of a wrapper, just send in the results the way you
                        got them.
