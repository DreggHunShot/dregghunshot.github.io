            <h3>Whoami</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p> I am a Hungarian cyber security enthusiast, bug bounty hunter, ethical hacker and university student (not
                    for
                    long, about to graduate). I love playing CTFs, I find them
                    both really useful and fun when it comes to learning new things in the cyber security field. I think
                    these competitions are perfect for fine tuning your skillset
                    as a security researcher, or even adding new tools to your sec-toolbelt, especially if you come
                    across
                    one that is real life like, with challenges you can find
                    'out in the wild'.
                </p>
                <p>I always try to improve my skillset, I try to learn something new in the field every week, and since
                    I'm a student I'm not currently working, but i plan on working in cyber security in the future.
                </p>
                <p>I play CTFs as a member of the Hungarian team <a class="body-link" href="../../html/introduction/13378015.html">1337B01S</a>
                    or
                    <a class="body-link" href="../../html/introduction/13378015.html">0x13378015</a>, we tend to use all kinds of
                    variations of the name. We started out as 3 members, and originally came together to partake in the
                    biggest Hungarian cyber security competition, the <a class="body-link"
                        href="https://nki.gov.hu/intezet/tartalom/hcsc19/">HCSC</a> aka.
                    Hungarian Cyber Security Challenge. Our team grew quite a lot since then, but we try to keep it
                    relatively small sized. We operate mostly on discord, so far none of our members met the others IRL,
                    but that should change when we attend <a class="body-link"
                        href="https://2020.bsidesbud.com/">BSIDESBUD</a>. Our
                    discord is currently not open to the public, but this might change in the future.
                </p>
                <p>I am also an active, currently VIP member on Hack the box, trying to get the highest rannk i can. I
                    also do retired boxes and challenges, boxes so I can practise
                    for the OSCP exam that I am planning to attempt this summer (2020) if all goes according to plan.
                    Here is my HTB public profile link if someone is interested:

            <h3 style='margin-top: 1rem;'>Writeups and this page</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>I've made this page mainly to have a place where i can post my writeups about CTFs and other stuff.
                    One reason for it was to have something open to
                    the public so i can send in my writeup links, and the other was to have a place to store all the
                    information
                    besides my computer.
                </p>
                <p> Even though my team is in fact Hungarian, I'll make all my writeups in English,
                    so everyone can understand it. I don't have perfect English, but I believe it's decent enough to
                    create writeups. I do plan to translate my English writeups to Hungarian in the future, but not sure
                    if I'll have enough time to do so.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p>I own a youtube channel, I do take breaks from uploading when life gets too busy, but there are a few
                    vids on it which people can find useful. It is entirely in Hungarian though. The name is: <a
                        class="body-link"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5Nt2oitHKlczaSQvy6LYA">DreggHunShot</a>. So far it's
                    mostly beginner oriented, but i plan on making more CTF tutorials and hackthebox and vulnhub
                    walkthroughs on it.</p>
