                    <a class="body-link" href="#">13378015</a> is actually quite a new CTF team, we started in October
                    2019, and started doing actual CTFs
                    in like November / December of 2019. We plan on being really active in 2020, and hopefully later
                    too.
                    My team started out as 3 members (I was one of the OG 3), and originally came together to partake in
                    the
                    biggest Hungarian cyber security competition in 2019, the <a class="body-link"
                        href="https://nki.gov.hu/intezet/tartalom/hcsc19/">HCSC</a> also known as the
                    Hungarian Cyber Security Challenge. The team kept growing, people came from all kinds of places,
                    from my <a class="body-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5Nt2oitHKlczaSQvy6LYA">youtube
                        channel</a> (quite
                    a small channel, and it's only in Hungarian, and I don't really have much time making videos for it
                    because I spend most of my time studying the cyber sec. field), and
                    also a few of them are friends of one of the 3 original
                    members. This is how our team grew to a currently 13 members size, with 5-6 really active CTF
                    players. We'd
                    like to keep our team relatively small sized, because we don't really like how large teams operate,
                    but
                    we will be launching a 0x13374C4D3MY soon, which will be an 'Academy' for our main CTF team, and
                    it's a
                    way to find talented and dedicated people and expand the main team.</p>
                <p>We operate mostly on discord, so far none of our members met the others IRL,
                    but that should change when we attend <a class="body-link"
                        href="https://2020.bsidesbud.com/">BSIDESBUD</a>, since many members plan to do so. Our
                    discord is currently not open to the public, but this might change in the future. We haven't tried
                    any offline CTF events yet, mostly because there aren't many in Hungary, but if we make it to the
                    finals in 2020's HCSC, this should also change.</p>
                <p>Every single member in the team is Hungarian, we don't plan to make the team international at the
                    moment, but of course anything can happen. We are currently at <a class="body-link"
                        href="https://ctftime.org/stats/HU">2nd place in Hungary</a> on CTF time, and <a
                        class="body-link" href="https://ctftime.org/team/107200">195th place overall</a> this year. </p>
